            Since I began my journey in web development 8 years ago, with the last <strong class="text-primary">four years centered on Front-End part</strong>. I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, allowing me to develop skills such as <strong class="text-primary">teamwork, coordination, and team leadership</strong>, as well as improving my programming logic, among others.
            
            Outside the realm of programming, I enjoy creating board games. To me, it's a similar process to creating software. First, conceive the basic idea, transform it into something playable, define the rules, and verify its correctness. Then, repeatedly test the game to refine it, and finally, present it to the user to obtain the necessary feedback and perfect it. The best part is when it's nearing completion, and you see people playing with the game.
            
            In the future, I aspire to continue working in Full-stack to design new interfaces and keep elevating my programming and logic skills.`
